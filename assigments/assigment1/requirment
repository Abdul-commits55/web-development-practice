CRUD App with Form & Table

🎯 Objective

Build a simple web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where the user can:

Add new records (user details) through a form.

Display all records inside a table.

Edit any existing record.

Delete any record.


This will give you hands-on practice with form handling, DOM manipulation, arrays, and events.


---

🔹 Part 1 – Setup the Form

Create an HTML form with the following fields:

Name (text input)

Email (email input)

Submit button



When the user fills the form and clicks submit, the details should be stored in a JavaScript array or object.


---

🔹 Part 2 – Display Data in a Table

Create a table with headings:
Sr. No | Name | Email | Actions

Every time a new record is added, it should appear as a new row in the table.

The Actions column should have two buttons: Edit and Delete.



---

🔹 Part 3 – Add Operation

When the user enters details and clicks Submit, the data should be saved and displayed in the table immediately.

Example:

Sr. No | Name       | Email
1      | Ali Khan   | ali@email.com

🔹 Part 4 – Edit Operation

When the user clicks Edit on a row:

The existing data of that row should appear back inside the form (so the user can change it).

The Submit button should update the record instead of adding a new one.


After editing, the table should refresh with updated values.



---

🔹 Part 5 – Delete Operation

When the user clicks Delete on a row:

That specific record should be removed from the table.

The remaining records should re-adjust (serial numbers update accordingly).




---

🔹 Part 6 – Extra (Optional for More Practice)

Validation: Don’t allow empty fields.

Local Storage: Save records in the browser’s storage so data remains after refresh.

Styling: Use CSS to make the form and table look clean and professional.



---

🏆 Expected Outcome

By the end, you’ll have a working mini-app where:

1. User enters Name + Email in the form.


2. Data shows in a table.


3. User can edit or delete any record.


4. The app demonstrates all four CRUD operations:

Create → Add a record.

Read → Show in table.

Update → Edit a record.

Delete → Remove a record.

👉 Do you want me to also give you a step-by-step guide (like “Step 1: Make form in HTML, Step 2: Make table…”) so you can try to build it gradually without seeing the final code?
